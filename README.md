# Janbao

A small forum app for Janbao.

## Development

```sh
bun install
cp .env.example .env
bun run dev
```

Common checks:

```sh
bun run check
bun run lint
bun run build
```

Local development uses `.local.db`. Database migrations in `drizzle/local-migrations/`
are applied automatically when the app starts.

## Media storage

Avatars and attachments use pCloud by default. Set `MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`
to use any S3-compatible service with AWS Signature Version 4:

```dotenv
MEDIA_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
S3_BUCKET=example-bucket
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_SESSION_TOKEN=
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=false
S3_PREFIX=Janbao
S3_CDN_BASE_URL=https://cdn.example.com
```

`S3_SESSION_TOKEN` is only required for temporary credentials.
`S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` defaults to `true`; set it to `false` for virtual-hosted-style
endpoints. `S3_PREFIX` and `S3_CDN_BASE_URL` are optional. Without a CDN URL, the
application reads private objects through signed S3 requests and streams them to clients.
Avatars are stored at `<prefix>/avatars/<userId>` and replaced on update, matching
the existing pCloud layout. Application URLs retain `/avatar/<userId>/<sha>.<ext>`.
With `S3_CDN_BASE_URL` configured, avatar routes validate the published database version
and return a non-cacheable 302 to `<cdn>/<prefix>/avatars/<userId>?v=<avatarFileId>`.
This includes imported avatars with version `1`. The CDN serves the image and handles
ETag revalidation; include the `v` query parameter in its cache key. New avatar writes
set `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, must-revalidate`; configure the CDN to honor
this finite TTL. Existing objects retain their current metadata until rewritten or
updated separately, so this application change alone does not change their CDN TTL.
The user-ID object is mutable: old CDN version URLs may return newer bytes after expiry,
and must not be configured as immutable. Without a CDN, avatar routes proxy and verify
the stored bytes against the requested SHA. Pending uploads are hidden and concurrent uploads are rejected.
An interrupted process can leave a publication lock: stop avatar writers before
reconciling the fixed object and database metadata; do not clear a lock while its
writer may still be running. Cleanup failures log the object path, and failed
restorations log the avatar and retained backup paths. Configure storage lifecycle
cleanup for abandoned `tmp/` uploads with enough retention for manual recovery;
pCloud temporary objects need equivalent scheduled cleanup.
Attachments use `<prefix>/attachments/<sha>` and retain immutable caching.
`S3_ENDPOINT` must be the service-level endpoint without the bucket name; the application
adds `S3_BUCKET` according to the selected addressing style.

Provider selection has no cross-provider fallback. When changing an existing deployment,
all referenced media objects must already exist in the newly selected provider. This
project does not migrate old media automatically.

## Docker

Create the runtime env file first:

```sh
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```

Set `JWT_SECRET` in `.env.docker` before the first boot:

```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Run with compose:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

The app listens on <http://localhost:3000>. The SQLite database is stored at
`./data/janbao.db`.

Build the image manually:

```sh
docker build -t janbao:local .
```

Run the image manually:

```sh
mkdir -p data
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env.docker \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v "$PWD/data:/data" \
  janbao:local
```

To reuse a local database:

```sh
mkdir -p data
cp .local.db data/janbao.db
docker compose up --build
```

## Published Docker images

GitHub Actions publishes images to GitHub Container Registry:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:latest
```

Published tags:

- `latest` for pushes to `master`
- `master` for pushes to `master`
- `v1.0.0` style tags for version releases
- `sha-<commit>` for pinned deployments

To publish a version:

```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Server operations

The bare-metal Bun deployment can install `scripts/janbaoctl` as
`/usr/local/sbin/janbaoctl`. Run it as root:

```sh
janbaoctl status
janbaoctl backup
janbaoctl stop
janbaoctl start
janbaoctl restart
janbaoctl deploy                   # origin/master
janbaoctl deploy <commit-or-tag>
janbaoctl rollback <commit-or-tag>
janbaoctl rollback <commit-or-tag> <database-backup>
janbaoctl backups
janbaoctl restore <database-backup>
```

Deployments create a verified SQLite snapshot before changing revisions. Local snapshots
are stored in `/var/backups/janbao`, with the newest 14 retained by default. They contain
the database only; media objects require a separate backup. Configuration paths and
retention can be overridden with the `JANBAO_*`
environment variables declared at the top of the script.

## Data import

Configure the selected media provider first. For pCloud, the setup helper can create
the required folders:

```sh
bun scripts/setup-pcloud.ts
```

Import a crawled Vanilla Forums export:

```sh
bun scripts/import-data.ts <path-to-data-directory>
```

Run the import on the host machine, not inside the Docker image. The import script
expects `cwebp` and `gif2webp` to be available on `PATH`.
