 * Commit a streamed upload using DB-write-first / MOVE-second ordering with

 * DB-first is structurally cleaner than MOVE-first with file-side compensation.
 * The compensation always undoes OUR DB write, which is uniquely ours to undo,
 * never a shared file. For content-addressed attachments the destination file
 * may already be referenced by a pre-existing row for the same sha (a prior or
 * concurrent upload of identical bytes), so deleting it on a later DB failure
 * would orphan that reference. Undoing our own row never has that problem.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *  - dbWrite throws: move is not attempted; no compensation.
 *  - move throws after a successful dbWrite: rollbackDbWrite is awaited
 *    best-effort; its errors are surfaced via console.error so they are not
 *    lost, but they never mask the original failure.
 *  - both succeed: no compensation.
 *
 * The original failure is re-thrown so the caller maps it to its HTTP response.
