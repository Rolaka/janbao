	/**
	 * Header Organism - the global App Bar (rendered once in AppShell).
	 *
	 * Desktop: logo + navigation links (Activity / Messages / Search). In flow
	 * (`md:static`); hide-on-scroll does not run.
	 *
	 * Mobile: sticky (fixed under `html.fixed-viewport`) with hide-on-scroll.
	 *
	 * Mobile: a 2-panel horizontal track (root panel + search panel, mirrors the
	 * NavPipelineTabHost pattern). The search button is a SINGLE
	 * absolutely-positioned `<a>` whose `left` is a reactive `style` binding
	 * (no CSS transition): one icon, no duplicate. Entering search slides the
	 * track left (root content exits left, search content pushes in from the
	 * right) while the search button independently travels right-to-left,
	 * stopping at the hamburger's position.
	 *
	 * The root↔deep vertical morph (BurgerArrowIcon + title) lives INSIDE panel 0
	 * but is FROZEN during a search transition (the tabs must exit horizontally
	 * with the track, never float up vertically).
	 *
	 * The SearchTabBar row clip-expands (max-height 0 → 3rem) rather than jumping.
	 *
	 * RENDER-ONLY (DV20 step 3): the Header is a reader of the pipeline
	 * orchestrator's reactive class fields. The orchestrator owns the
	 * settle ease (the morph + title crossfade during a gesture release,
	 * a discrete nav, or an idle title change at landing), the root↔search / deep↔search
	 * tap-scrub ease, and the `searchScrubbing` flag; this component reads
	 * `orchestrator.settleProgress` (titleView spans),
	 * `orchestrator.settleMorphFraction` (morph derivation),
	 * `orchestrator.settleLatched`, `orchestrator.settleActive`,
	 * `orchestrator.settleDirection`, `orchestrator.searchScrubbing`,
	 * `pager.tapMorph`, `pager.backMorph`, `pager.dragging`,
	 * `pager.scrubIconEndpoint`, and `pager.transitionTarget`, and derives
	 * every visual from them and the `dragMorphAnchor` / `searchAnchor` /
	 * `dragSearchAnchor` getters (consumed by the morph / searchProgress
	 * derivations below).
	 * No Header-owned rAF, no Header-owned animation state, no CSS transitions
	 * in this layer. §5: the orchestrator (publication record + pager-store morph
	 * fields it writes via #republishToPager; synchronous per
	 * pointermove during a drag, via the rAF channels during a commit/settle/scrub)
	 * drives every motion; the
	 * hide-on-scroll `translateY` is a reactive read of the scroll-chrome
	 * store (its own rAF-throttled scroll listener publishes each frame).

	//      `isSearch`-inverted (1 = not search, 0 = search), so searchProgress
	//      = 1 - tapMorph. Drives the root↔search AND the deep↔search
	//      trajectories (the orchestrator arms the scrub on any isSearch
	//      flip). Reading tapMorph directly (not via trackMorph + isSearch)
	//      is required for the deep↔search EXIT: once the URL lands on a
	//      deep page isSearch is false and the gated fallback below would
	//      clamp to 0; tapMorph drives the slide back to 0 over the scrub.
	//   2. A settle in flight with a search anchor
	//      (`orchestrator.searchAnchor !== null`). The orchestrator seeds the
	//      anchor at five boundary handoffs where the natural switch below
	//      would snap (R23-B + R24-A + R91): the `playEnterAnimation`
	//      commit-to-enter handoff (R23-B F2: a forward-swipe-to-`/search`
	//      commit ends at raw=1 with the panel slid fully in, the enter
	//      slide's natural `1 - trackMorph = bm` resets 1 -> 0 -> 1 across
	//      the host swap, snapping fully out then back in; the seed holds
	//      `start = dest = 1` so the panel stays slid in across the settle);
	//      the discrete-nav arm drag interrupt (R23-B F1: a non-search
	//      `goto` / tab-click / popstate interrupts a forward-swipe-to-
	//      `/search` drag with the panel `bm` of the way in, the dest is
	//      non-search, the natural switch collapses `bm` -> 0 in one frame;
	//      the seed lerps from the captured live `bm` to 0 across the
	//      discrete-nav settle); the `#accelerateInFlight` enter interrupt
	//      (R24-A: a non-search `goto` interrupts an in-flight enter settle
	//      on `/search`, the accelerate's `#armSettleEase` clears the anchor
	//      that the enter seeded at hold-1; the re-seed carries the held-at-1
	//      panel position across the accelerated re-arm); the
	//      `notifyHeaderState` mid-settle absorb (R24-A: a dynamic-title
	//      route resolves a new title mid-enter on a `/search` commit, the
	//      re-arm clears the anchor mid-flight; the re-seed carries the
	//      in-flight search-axis position across the re-arm); and the
	//      `#armSettleEaseFromGesture` gesture-release re-seed (R91: a
	//      re-grab whose `#dragSearchAnchor` shifted the gesture formula;
	//      the re-seed carries the drag's terminal search-axis value
	//      across the settle-arm clear). The lerp eases
	//      `start` (the captured pre-boundary value) to `dest` (the dest's
	//      at-rest searchProgress) across `settleMorphFraction`. At settle
	//      end (`settleMorphFraction = 1`) the lerp equals `dest`, which
	//      agrees with the at-rest switch (`isSearch ? 1 : 0`) at the
	//      post-settle `isSearch`, so the anchor is cleared without a snap.
	//      Mirrors the morph axis's `settleLatched.startMorph` -> `destMorph`
	//      lerp and the FAB axis's `#enterFabAnchor` lerp.
	//   3. A drag in flight with a drag search anchor
	//      (`orchestrator.dragSearchAnchor !== null`). When a re-grab takes
	//      over an in-flight search settle (`#beginGesture` with
	//      `settleActive && #searchAnchor !== null`), the settle is cancelled
	//      and the `settleActive` flag flip makes branch 2 short-circuit, handing the search
	//      axis to the natural gesture formula below, whose `bm` value at
	//      the takeover disagrees with the held settle lerp (R26-A:
	//      ~238px snap on a 393px viewport). The orchestrator captures
	//      the search-axis position via `#searchProgressAtSettleInstant`
	//      BEFORE the cancel and exposes it via `dragSearchAnchor`; this
	//      branch shifts the natural gesture formula so it passes through
	//      `(anchor.raw, anchor.search)`:
	//      `shifted(bm) = anchor.search + natural(bm) - natural(anchor.raw)`,
	//      where `natural(t)` is the gesture formula in branch 4 evaluated
	//      at `bm = t`. The shift is constant in bm (the natural slope is
	//      preserved), so the formula stays a pure function of `bm` (DV21
	//      §5). Clamped to [0, 1] for the cancel overshoot. Mirrors the
	//      morph axis's `dragMorphAnchor` shift and the FAB axis's
	//      `dragFabAnchor` shift.
	//   4. A gesture in flight (transitionTarget + backMorph). The publication
	//      runs while the source route is still mounted, so isSearch matches
	//      the pre-flip endpoint:
	//      - EXIT (isSearch, source is /search): the search panel leaves,
	//        1 → 0, so searchProgress = 1 - trackMorph.
	//      - ENTER (targetIsSearch, target is /search from a forward
	//        last-tab swipe): the search panel enters, 0 → 1, so
	//        searchProgress = trackMorph.
	//   5. At rest: isSearch ? 1 : 0.

			// `anchor.raw` is computed on the same path-equality relation.
			// When `backMorph === null` (a tab-to-tab re-grab on a non-
			// centerTab host) the gesture branch below is skipped because

			// stays continuous with the prior settle (R26-A design,
			// mirrors the morph axis's `nullBmAnchor` hold branch). For
			// a `/search`-commit settle re-grabbed into a tab-to-tab
			// swipe `anchor.search = 1` (the panel was fully slid in);
			// the hold keeps it visible for the drag's duration and the
